Career Myths (the illusion of job security):
- study hard, work hard, be loyal, find a stable job and retire.
- your company will take care of your career.
- follow your passion.
- your job must have meaning and purpose.

Career Goals and Objectives:
- Career Longevity: have a sustainable career because our work, services, skills are continually in demand by employers until the day we exit the market.
- Career Satisfaction: achieve satisfaction through striving for career success (money, title, corner office, co-workers, work life balance, meaningful work)
- Personal Happiness: achieved through family, friends, money, health, hobbies, religion, sleep, relationships, etc.
- describe and understand our personal vision and meaning of career success (what's important to us), and work towards these goals.

Career Strategy:
- a plan we develop based on self discovery, self knowledge and market trends, identifying our strengths, weaknesses, passion and values, as well as various market opportunities and threats, and immediate and long term needs.
- a roadmap of where we want to be years into the future and how to get there.

Career Strategy Framework:
- Think long term: identify gaps in skills and experience, look for jobs or projects that can provide that kind of exposure, consider if these roles make sense in the bigger scheme of things.
- Know your career direction (Career Quadrants/Crossover Quadrants Model): a change in industry or a change in role or both; reasons: boredom, better exposure or growth prospects.
- Quadrant 1 - join a competitor; Quadrant 2 - switching industries; Quadrant 3 - switching roles; Quadrant 4 - total career switch.
- Determine our Career Velocity: Accelerate, Hover, Downshift, Pause (sabbatical), Exit (retire).
- Determine our Skills Intent: Specialisation (but usually there's greater demand for generalists, except for critical roles), Enrichment (broadening scope of products, regions, or areas of responsibility, or move up value chain to higher value added activities or functions), Create a Role (for skills that are very unique, which require accurate targeting, good networking, effective pitching, excellent negotiating skills, and a lot of research), Reboot (reskilling from ground zero and join a new industry, perhaps at a entry level position, emphasis on staying agile in the jobs market and dive into new areas for career growth and longevity).
- Develop a Deeper Understanding of our Target Market (know both the industry and role very well, know where the real demand for my skillsets are from, know the future trends and which skills have increased demand)
- Conclusion: Map out the industries we want to join, the reasons we'll be good at it, and who we can approach to learn more about these; commit to a plan and spend time thinking about it, network with key decision makers in those industries to learn more and expose ourselves to their influencers, let them know how we can help and offer assistance to let them be aware of us, keep improving with the latest tools and mental models, and attend online courses.

Career Agility:
- the ability to anticipate and respond appropriately to career opportunity and threats, to achieve career longevity and satisfaction.
- entails a certain degree of versatility, adaptability, and proactiveness in managing our own careers.
- Understand and anticipate demand for skills by conducting industry analysis and role analysis.
- Industry Analysis: identify important trends by conducting market research (corporate websites, competitors' websites); map all business partners, suppliers, vendors, distributors, and customers that form the ecosystem of the industry - which are growing?  Build a larger picture of what each companies focus on, and their inter-relationships, and include contacts; watch for interesting announcements, significant events, how the events affect industry equilibrium, is there a trend or disruption?
- when speaking to people, use LinkedIn.
- form our own opinion about the future of the industry, be part of the change or be the disruption!
- Role Analysis: to fully understand skills demand, identify specific required skills for the role, understand how roles are evolving and what skills are needed.
- Understand and articulate the supply of skills because we get paid for the valuable services we provide, our salary is our company's monthly subscription to our skills and contribution.
- The supply of skills is what we have to offer the employment market!

Q&A for Skills Audit (determine our strengths and areas of development):
- Can we articulate and list our repertoire of skills?
- Are our skills still relevant in today's market?
- Will our skills be relevant for tomorrow's market?
- How proficient are we at these skills?
- Are your skills industry specific or are they transferable to another industry?
- Which other industries would love to buy your skills?
- What are the future skills needed by the market, and how would we acquire them?
- What are the gaps in my skills and how would I close them?
My Skills Audit:
- How many skills do I have?
- Are they updated and relevant?
- Is there good demand for these skills?
- Are they so specialised that they are not transferable to another industry?
- Can an RPA Robotic Software Automation do it?
- Can someone younger, cheaper, located offshore do it?
My Skills Gaps:
- What are the skills in demand today and will be in demand in the next 5 years?
- Would I enjoy acquiring and performing those skills?
- Are those skills in line with my Career Strategy?
- Would my previous or current skills complement this list of skills?
- How would I go about acquiring those new skills?
Exercise:
- List my top 10 latest skills, the skills I was paid for in my current or previous job.  next to each skill, write down the scope, scale, industry, clients, budget size, number of people involved, results, and other relevant information.
- What skills do I enjoy and dislike?
- What do we really want and don't want to do?
- What I want more and less of?
- Am I pursuing my interests?
- What are my values?
- Is the industry aligned to my values?
- What is my work life equilibrium?
- How important is team dynamics?
- Are corporate values important to me?
- Identify limitations and gaps: does chosen career path require further education, training or certification?  How much do I need to start a business?  Is there a gap in my experience or skills that will stop me from getting my desired role?  Does my new career choice pay enough for my chosen lifestyle?  Is there a match between my personality traits and the career choice?
- Set up a table: Gaps, Why, Action Steps, Resources and Contacts, Deadlined Objective.

Enhance our skills:
- Upskill - observe and identify what our bosses do that we aren't ready to handle yet, learn through observation or by asking them.
- Cross-skill - learn cross disciplinary skills from colleagues from different departments.
- Deep-skill - become the subject matter expert in our chosen profession, invest in formal training or sign up for free online courses.
- Today, it is no longer a jobs market, but a skills market.
- Skills have expiry dates, and there are always cheaper, faster, and better skilled people waiting to take our jobs, so be adaptable to stay employable.
- Identify our skills gaps and take action by signing up for courses, or take every chance to work on projects that require them, even though extra hours of daunting work required.
- Think long term by taking a hard look at our Career Strategy and assess our future prospects realistically: is there a clear pathway to the goal?  are we well networked into that target industry?  start making a plan and take action because the volatile business environment does not give us the luxury of time to only react to changes.
- Articulate our skills concisely and accurately: what is our superpower?  how do we position our superpower and skills?  did we provide context and scope?  do not rely on oversimplified key words and hope the listener will connect the dots.
