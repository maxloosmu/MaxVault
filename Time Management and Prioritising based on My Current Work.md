## Time Management and Prioritising based on My Current Work

I write this referencing and adapting the content from the book "Thriving At Work: What School Doesn't Teach You (International Edition)" Chapter 28 "How to Manage Time and Prioritize Effectively".

### General Work Tasks - Important and needed
Since I'm doing research into computational law, I read a lot about coding from books or the Internet, and also do some reading into areas related to maths, logic, technology, language, law, business and economics. I also do some coding in the process of learning and for projects. Tasks are generally managed using Asana, discussions done using Slack, and I email weekly work reports to a couple of my colleagues.

### General Life Tasks - Important and wanted
Depending on serendipitous encounters with good books, papers or Internet articles, I also spend some time reading about topics such as learning, working, thinking, and how to live life with wisdom. These readings may be zero to several hours every week. After I do my readings for work and life, I sometimes write about them in blogs, such as this current post, so that these information can be organised and recorded for future reference, and also shared with others. I do not see these as time wasters.

### Handling Time-Wasters
I usually terminate phone calls without answering because they are usually spam. I seldom interact with colleagues in my 3–4 hours in the office on most days of the week including sometimes on both Saturday and Sunday because most work from home. Everyday, I usually spend about 1–2 hours watching or reading general news. This is also when I'll sometimes message my friends.

Currently, I spend 2–3 hours every week on Slack and emails. My emails, computer files and folders are organised properly, and I usually rarely spend time organising the information I printed out for reading, because I usually just read and file. I do spend a little more time condensing the information to print because I usually print 8 pages on one sheet of paper using small font sizes.

Admittedly, as I mostly work from home, I seldom encounter noisy co-workers, but there is one particular co-worker from another department who works in the same office I use, and who usually talks a lot with his colleagues, which can be a little distracting if I happen to be seated too close by. My commute times on buses everyday are short, but I spend about 2 hours everyday on the train. Fortunately, trains are more stable and has less nausea inducing vibrations than buses, so I spend my time on the train reading, so it's usually time well spent.

### Life and Work Admin Timeouts - Unimportant but needed
I spend 8–12 hours everyday sleeping because I have irregular sleeping hours. This irregularity is not socially imposed, and most of the time, it's not due to work. At work, I spend 2–3 hours in a weekly meeting, which is conducted mainly for coordinating and learning purposes.

I do have many medical appointments and do fall sick. These events usually occur 1–3 times each month, but unless I fall sick and need to rest, I'll just spend the time waiting to see the doctor or specialist reading, so time is not totally wasted. I only spend about 15 min every week on fitness exercises I can do as a disabled person. As a Christian, I usually spend 1–2 hours every week listening to online sermons. I occasionally spend 2–3 hours a month on cell group meetings conducted online.
