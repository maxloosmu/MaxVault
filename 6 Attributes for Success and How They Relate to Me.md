I did a quick self analysis based on a chapter in the book "The Earned Life.  Lose Regret, Choose Fulfillment".  Although I'm doing research into computational law now, I'm also learning more about web development now, so I'll use that for my analysis.  

There are 6 attributes for success at work, 4 of which are internal (motivation, ability, understanding, confidence), while 2 are external (support, marketplace).  

Motivation
My reasons for doing web development is firstly tied to the many jobs available for web developers.  Secondly, I hope to get a good paycheck from this work.  Thirdly, I like learning, analytical and constructive work.  Lastly, there may be a slim chance of building up a useful web service that is well received by the public.  

Ability
I'm trained as an engineer.  Since my school days, I have been better at learning, analytical and constructive work.  I've also learned and developed a few websites.  

Understanding
I understand that a website must have users, so the most important criteria of all websites is user satisfaction.  Hence, I continuously research and read up on available content to better understand the users' needs as well as how and what I can learn or do to achieve that.  

Confidence
I have the desire, some talent and some knowledge of web development, but I must say my confidence is not so high, partly because the knowledge and skills that a web developer needs is increasing with time.  These increases sometimes jump significantly when a new web development language or paradigm is introduced or when there are continual developments in the language or paradigm due to popularity.  My concern is that I may require a lot of learning time to keep up with most of the developments, which will reduce the amount of time I spend coding and building or improving a website.  

Support
In my current job, I have the support of my team, especially my team leader, to learn more about web development so that I can improve on our website project.  I must admit that I also have access to a wide variety of online and offline content to learn and do my work.  

Marketplace
Websites are now the norm in the working and non-working world.  There will always be paid work for different types of websites.
