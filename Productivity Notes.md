Productivity Goals
- I complete the needed tasks and routines quickly, leaving more time to read new news, self improve, and learn.  
- I wander towards goals if they are difficult, and collect and adapt information to my life through writings.

Ideas and Tasks
- keep daily to do lists, and plan ahead by journaling and visualising the completion of goals.
- at start of day or week and throughout work and free time, write down tasks to do, decide and map out how to deal with them, and then focus on the DO NOW task.
- record unexpected ideas, with an easy way to record, and by emptying our filled minds to make space.

Goals and Tasks
- be open and accountable with my goals, know myself, and be honest with myself.
- set SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely.
- set PURE goals: positive, understandable, relevant, ethical.
- focus on a few key intentions and goals, create short and long term goals.
- select key tasks to do, drop out the rest (decide my priorities based on importance + urgency, and value), try to focus and do deep work.
- know what motivates me to narrow the focus.
- timebox the required level of task perfection, avoid perfection addiction, just try to do well.
- start doing and try to complete tasks based on priorities.
- multitask with great care.
- group tasks together for efficiency.

Internal Sources of Productivity
- break down a time consuming task into smaller parts to simplify it.
- find the 20% of effort that delivers 80% of results, avoid unnecessary involvements.
- always do the right things right, don't cheat.
- decide on repetitions in daily tasks: routines.
- systematically replicate successes: cheat sheets, instruction guides, recordings, automation, SLA (Service Level Agreements).
- work in bursts interspersed with breaks.
- sleep and rest well: make and block out time for myself for rest and reflections.
- hope for the best, plan for the worst "what ifs", seek regular feedback, celebrate successes.
- avoid burning out: admit to struggles, admit uncertainties in timelines, know our capacity, avoid saying yes when no is required, eliminate mental overload, avoid overtime and workaholism, find suitable work pace, plant as many seeds as possible, and rest and recover.
- accept change to the point of moving beyond comfort zone, change what needs changing, but accept what cannot be changed.
- create not to do lists.

On Play
- flow with what i love doing: focus on, and find purpose, meaning and joy in the process
- lower the stakes and reframe failures, find the joy and try adventurous play, choose my character, embrace curiosity and be sincere, track + monitor + review the progress and outcome.

On Power
- self motivate and believe in myself to empower myself, get confidence from people around us, improve our skills by learning through doing with a beginner's curious, open, humble and more resilient mind for a fresh, innovative and experimental perspective, try to be a teacher offering guidance, take ownership of my work, take ownership of the process if not the situation, own my mindset by choosing to do the work: to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.

On People
- find our scene or community, and adopt a comrade and team player mindset, find synchronicity using random acts of kindness or asking for help to find helpers and help ourselves, overcommunicate good news by celebrating people's wins actively and constructively: "That's wonderful news!  I've seen how you've tried so hard at it.  You have a good future ahead of you!", learn to overcommunicate unpleasant news too by being candid: "Here's what I think.  Can you hear me out or help me out?  We can do it together."
- be candid by not assuming we know the truth, by rooting our analysis in objective, factual and non-judgemental terms, focus on the tangible results of what's gone wrong by highlighting observations, do not be subjective, turn our attention away from the problem and towards the solution.

On Seeking Clarity
- more motivation or discipline may not resolve procrastination, find mental or physical blockers that are causing procrastination: what's really blocking our good mood?
- avoid reinforcing the uncertainty anxiety paralysis loop: do not overestimate what's at stake, do not be hypervigilant for anything negative and do not stop recognising safety cues, do not be avoidant.
- ask "why" and "how" to resolve the purpose behind the project, the end state, and key tasks.
- use the 5 whys to determine whether a task is worth doing, so that attention is kept on what matters.
- ask "what" to convert the purpose into a set of concrete goals and actions.
- set NICE goals: Near-term, Input-based, Controllable, Energising.
- some other goals:
    - FOCUSED: Flexible, Observable, Consistent, Universal, Simple, Explicit, Directed.
    - HARD: Heartfelt, Animated, Required, Difficult.
- imagine one week later, and we haven't started the task we intended to do: what are the top three reasons why we didn't start?
- what can we do to help mitigate the risk of the top three reasons?
- who can we ask for help in sticking to this commitment?
- what action can we take right now that will help increase the odds that we'll actually do the task?
- some plans won't go according to plan, so we need to plan for that too.
- ask "when" to accept our limitations in time, use implementation intentions or triggers: "If X happens, just do Y", use time blocking to ensure enough time for everything important: "Level 1 for tasks we've been avoiding, Level 2 for time blocking most of the day into a schedule, Level 3 for time blocking the entire week by setting aside time for all things important to us", but not to be fixated to a rigid ideal schedule.

On Finding Courage
- fear may be holding us back, not lack of talent or inspiration.
- know and understand our fears through labelling emotions and identities.
- reduce our fears through the "will this matter in 10 minutes, 10 weeks, 10 years" rule.
- when self doubt causes procrastination, raise our <<self confidence = perception of ability - perception of standards>> equation, then make a start without inhibitions from perfectionism.
- overcome our fear by choosing a powerful, confident, brave, determined and disciplined character alter ego to be; adopt the alter ego's posture, voice and mindset; repeat a mantra or affirmation: "I'm confident, I'm fearless, I'm unstoppable."
- use the "no one cares" mindset to reduce anxiety related procrastination, do not overestimate the degree of how others think of or judge us: everybody is mostly concerned with themselves and how they're coming across.

On Getting Started
- overcome procrastination inertia by reducing friction - the amount of energy needed to get started on a task.
- reduce environmental friction by setting up or laying out default choices in our living space.
- reduce emotional friction by applying the five-minute rule: start by committing our full attention on a task for 5 minutes.
- set up a bias to action by readying at least 1, 2, or 3 clear, concrete next steps or actions to take at every stage of the project or task, so that it takes our attention away from the intimidatingly huge long term goals and focusing our minds on the more achievable near-term actions.
- track our progress, so that we can focus on our constant progress towards our goals to motivate ourselves, and also identify areas we are falling behind and where we need to make adjustments, and patterns, habits or obstacles that may be hindering our progress.
- learn to support ourselves by finding an accountability buddy due to the energising effects of People, which also activates our sense of duty.
- accountability buddies should be disciplined, challenging, patient, supportive, and constructive.
- learn to forgive ourselves for our slips in taking action or making decisions, so as to let go of post-procrastination guilt and shame.
- learn to forgive ourselves by finding the win and celebrate, however small or unrelated the win is: "I didn't do X, but I did do Y."



On Learning
- be persistent, avoid hasty reactions, and learn from setbacks.
- double check assumptions even if it sounds stupid, and learn from mistakes.
- prioritise learning, and organise your tech tools.
- if in doubt, preferable to over-communicate.
- write down notes and double check to improve memory.
- identify personal strengths, develop new strengths, work with others' strengths, don't obsess over weaknesses.
- practise deliberately with focused attention, and mindful, purposeful and systematic repetitions.
- invest in myself, and be a subject matter expert if possible.

External Sources of Productivity
- be tech + AI savvy, avoid manual processes.
- ensure workplace ergonomics and tidiness.
- keep meetings short and focused on the agenda.
- don't permit unnecessary steals on my time from others, choose friends wisely.

Books
- I skipped Chapters 53-58, 60-61, 74-75, 77, 94-95 from the book "100 Things Productive People Do".
- I updated based on the book "Feel-Good Productivity: How to Do More of What Matters to You" until Chapter 2.

My Progress
- I do not have a problem with starting actions, but I have a problem deciding what actions to take or include.
- I do not have a problem tracking progress, but when there's too much information, it can be quite overwhelming.
- I may need to set NICE goals: Near-term, Input-based, Controllable, Energising.
