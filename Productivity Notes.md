Productivity Goals
- I complete the needed tasks and routines quickly, leaving more time to read new news, self improve, and learn.  
- I wander towards goals if they are difficult, and collect and adapt information to my life through writings.

Ideas and Tasks
- keep daily to do lists, and plan ahead by journaling and visualising the completion of goals
- at start of day or week and throughout work and free time, write down tasks to do, decide and map out how to deal with them, and then focus on the DO NOW task
- record unexpected ideas, with an easy way to record, and by emptying our filled minds to make space

Goals and Tasks
- be open and accountable with my goals, know myself, and be honest with myself
- set SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely
- set PURE goals: positive, understandable, relevant, ethical
- focus on a few key intentions and goals, create short and long term goals
- select key tasks to do, drop out the rest (decide my priorities based on importance + urgency, and value), try to focus and do deep work
- know what motivates me to narrow the focus
- timebox the required level of task perfection, avoid perfection addiction, just try to do well
- start doing and try to complete tasks based on priorities
- multitask with great care
- group tasks together for efficiency

Internal Sources of Productivity
- break down a time consuming task into smaller parts to simplify it
- find the 20% of effort that delivers 80% of results, avoid unnecessary involvements
- always do the right things right, don't cheat
- decide on repetitions in daily tasks: routines
- systematically replicate successes: cheat sheets, instruction guides, recordings, automation, SLA (Service Level Agreements)
- work in bursts interspersed with breaks
- sleep and rest well: make and block out time for myself for rest and reflections
- flow with what i love doing: focus on, and find purpose, meaning and joy in the process
- hope for the best, plan for the worst "what ifs", seek regular feedback, celebrate successes
- lower the stakes and reframe failures, find the joy and try adventurous play, choose my character, embrace curiosity and be sincere, track + monitor + review the progress and outcome
- avoid burning out: admit to struggles, admit uncertainties in timelines, know our capacity, avoid saying yes when no is required, eliminate mental overload, avoid overtime and workaholism, find suitable work pace, plant as many seeds as possible, and rest and recover
- accept change to the point of moving beyond comfort zone, change what needs changing, but accept what cannot be changed
- self motivate and believe in myself to empower myself, get confidence from people around us, improve our skills by learning through doing with a beginner's curious, open, humble and more resilient mind for a fresh, innovative and experimental perspective, try to be a teacher offering guidance, take ownership of my work, take ownership of the process if not the situation, own my mindset by choosing to do the work: to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances
- create not to do lists

On Learning
- be persistent, avoid hasty reactions, and learn from setbacks
- double check assumptions even if it sounds stupid, and learn from mistakes
- prioritise learning, and organise your tech tools
- if in doubt, preferable to over-communicate
- write down notes and double check to improve memory
- identify personal strengths, develop new strengths, work with others' strengths, don't obsess over weaknesses
- practise deliberately with focused attention, and mindful, purposeful and systematic repetitions
- invest in myself, and be a subject matter expert if possible

External Sources of Productivity
- be tech + AI savvy, avoid manual processes
- ensure workplace ergonomics and tidiness
- keep meetings short and focused on the agenda
- don't permit unnecessary steals on my time from others, choose friends wisely

Books
- I skipped Chapters 53-58, 60-61, 74-75, 77, 94-95 from the book "100 Things Productive People Do".
- I updated based on the book "Feel-Good Productivity: How to Do More of What Matters to You" until Chapter 2.
