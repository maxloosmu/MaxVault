How much in life is really actually up to us?
- accept that life is unfair and unjust, we're not born white or wealthy, we have no control over the circumstances we are born into, genetics also affects us.
- strive for structural change, advocate for equal opportunities.
- focus on what we can control, develop our skills.
- find closure.
- structure influences or limits choices and opportunities available.
- agency is the quantity of free will that an individual can use in their choices, what the person can do.
- agency includes our habits, the people around us, our values, our ability to make the right decisions.
- effects of structure compound: developed country, supportive culture, high socio-economic status.
- be empathetic to the less privileged, and be grateful for the opportunities we receive.
- everyone has different paths to success, and different definitions of success: do not compare.
- we never have 100% control over our destiny, but we must acknowledge that we have a role to play in our own lives, we can shift the course of our destiny with our actions.
- survive, then thrive.

Four Horsemen of Success
- hard work alone doesn't guarantee success.
- privilege: born into rich family allows us to take more risks; if we are not minority, we face less discrimination; if we are born in a modern and developed country, we live longer; we have no control over the privilege we receive, and we should not be ashamed of having it; if we reach a certain level of privilege, we may achieve financial success.
- effort/hard work/passion/perseverence: inspirational.
- distinction/unconventional/innovative: skills and knowledge matter; do out of the box thinking, creativity, and resourcefulness; if we work and think like everyone, do not expect extraordinary success.
- luck: we have no control over the luck we receive, but we can improve our chances with more effort, distinction, or privilege.

Stop blaming the poor for being poor
- even if we may have the resources and ability to improve our lives, we may be trapped in a cycle of poverty, which affects our decision making.
- most financial advice addresses people with average income, which becomes very complicated for the low income.
- being impoverished has psychological effects, such as stress, which affects decision making, leading to family violence, unhealthy addictions, and/or poor health.
- impoverished people may spend more than average, because they bought cheaper products that spoil faster, or spend more time travelling or doing things because they can't afford more expensive but efficient options, or end up with poor health.
- bad decisions compound over time, so climbing out of poverty becomes very difficult or nearly impossible without external help.
- solution is to withhold blame and judgement, practise empathy, take concrete action and make an impact.

Activities for growing wealth:
- Earning: earn to save, save to invest; earning ability depends on skills, network, ability to take risks.
- Saving and Spending: save more, spend less to create wealth.
- Investing: investing is crucial to grow wealth when we are not working, but investing comes with risk, and done poorly, become counter-productive.
- Protecting: insurance and risk management are also important.
- Getting the first 100K through Growth: inculcate cheap habits, avoid lifestyle inflation.
- Getting the next 100K through Maintenance: maintain skills, experience, network; use money to make money, average person may expect only 5-8% income a year, or lose all their investments.
- investing won't earn a lot at start, when capital small, returns are also small, so focus on increasing capital, work on our earning power (network, soft and hard skills): learn in demand skills, negotiate for increment, do a side hustle.
- hard skills are specific to industry: software and coding ability, foreign language skills, SEO marketing, etc professional certifications.
- soft skills are non technical skills: communication, teamwork, problem solving, time management, critical thinking, empathy.
- we are the best investment we can make.

To increase our income:
- work more or work harder
- switch to a more lucrative industry: what I am paid is a combination of supply and demand, who's paying me, what's my impact; our career choices will directly affect our income (depends on passion, work life balance, purpose, culture, investing time to learn skills, natural aptitude to do the job).
- cut out the middleman: be a freelancer or self-employed.
- take on risk and forgo stability: pay well if done well, but punished if no results.
- negotiate better: understand what we can charge for our skills based on market rate, knowing how to be assertive and fight for what we are worth, leaving the conversation open for future negotiations, building up the ability to walk away from bad deals, recognise when we have negotiating power and when we don't; even the best negotiators are limited by whether they can back their talk up.
- become irreplaceable: the lower the barrier of entry, the lower the salary; jobs that require special knowledge, skills or talent will pay more; do work that others are unwilling to do.
- lead people and learn how to organise labour: leadership skills/traits (reliability, communication and empathy, big picture thinking, self awareness, persuasion)
- write and speak well
- join profit centres
- know your worth and be ready to move
- as a salaryman, we are just a business selling services: our salary is just the monthly subscription our employer pay to have us.
- when our business don't earn enough from a client: we get more business/side hustles, increase prices/salary, or end the relationship.

the realities of the 2020s:
- people are living longer.
- popular places become more popular and more expensive.
- globalisation led to mobility of talent, capital and wealth across international borders, increasing competition for jobs, housing, food, etc.
- technology reshaped industries and displaced jobs.
- further education no longer provides economic and job security.

inequality due to:
- businesses seeking to maximise profit to benefit shareholders, resulting in CEOs performance tied to share price, short term profitability becomes important, win at all costs attitude, so businesses cut costs to improve profitability, including manpower costs.
- globalisation has resulted in hollowing out of industries from more advanced countries: countries of the world become more equal, but inequality within each country increased.
- globalisation makes it harder to tax the rich, because when the world becomes very connected, assets and money can easily flow out of a country, and the rich can also leave the country.
- governments have to deliver value to the wealthy who pay more taxes, such as safety, infrastructure, education, and protection of interests.
- governments have to tax a large number of the wealthy moderately.
- gentrification raises competition for housing, jobs, food, thereby raising prices, making everything more expensive.
- the internet allows cheaper labour in developing countries to compete with locals; software and automation have replaced many jobs and depressed wage growth; the rise of major tech companies that can scale to achieve high incomes and profits.
- immigrants, foreigners moving into my homeland: the wealthy prices me out, but spends more money; the talented outcompetes me, but may be able to teach me.
- foreigners that set up businesses locally can also create jobs by directly hiring locals, or working with smaller businesses which hire locals.
- governments need more taxes because public costs increasing due to aging populations, and shrinking working populations resulted in less tax collected.
- we cannot choose where others choose to come and go, but we can gain skills and build wealth.
- be content by not comparing with others; cultivate gratefulness for even the small things in life; avoid lifestyle inflation and be happy with less; declutter our homes and stop chasing trends set by others by focusing on our own needs.
