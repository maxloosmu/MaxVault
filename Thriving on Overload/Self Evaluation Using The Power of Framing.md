## Self Evaluation Using The Power of Framing

I'm doing this self evaluation using the power of framing based on the book "Thriving on Overload: the 5 Powers for Success in a World of Exponential Information".

Based on the majority of my posts on medium, I retagged each post, and used the Obsidian app to link the tags in each post into a network map that is displayed graphically.  Based on this, I discovered that my top three tags are self-improvement (8 counts), self-discovery (6 counts) and work (5 counts).  The reason why work does not have the highest number of counts is because I've posted many of my work blogs on the Google Blogger blog platform.  If those were included, the tag counts for programming (2 counts) and web development (3 counts) will definitely increase.  I've also posted a number of articles about sustainability and overpopulation issues in the past, and the reason why they did not show up, is because I've archived those posts and removed them from this analysis.  This is an indication of my current focus, which is to self-discover and self-improve for work to fulfill my life purpose of sufficiency in money to live properly and satisfying my personal values of gratitude, learning, responsibility and contribution.  This also shows the emphasis on Expertise and Identity in my life purpose.

In the book, framing is divided into a few categories: framing our thinking into trees, networks, systems or connected notes; framing by communicating; and framing the future.  The book also listed a few steps for creating our visual frameworks: selecting scope, considering the central logic, brainstorming of concepts, rearranging the elements in the framework, revealing relationships in the framework, and finally, develop the framework visually.  For the convenience of text blogs, my purpose framework can be presented as such:

self-discovery (purpose, values, identity) -> self-improvement (purpose, values, expertise) -> work (money) -> life (live properly)
