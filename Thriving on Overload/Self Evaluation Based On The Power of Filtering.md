## Self Evaluation Based On The Power of Filtering

I'm doing this self evaluation using the power of filtering based on the book "Thriving on Overload: the 5 Powers for Success in a World of Exponential Information".

Filtering is about identifying key portals of information, and choosing and curating the most relevant information based on our purpose and frameworks.  I consider information curation to be similar to information distillation or summary.  Sometimes we over filter because of our routines and habitual patterns.  Although there are both technological and cognitive filters, given that my time and my memory is limited, I filter heavily in accordance with my work, so I usually learn very little cognitively from my environment, and learn more through technology, such as reading the news about my environment digitally.  They are sufficient to help me maintain a deliberative mind, understand the world better, make better decisions, and have a higher likelihood of living a contented life.

Besides being more deliberative and probabilistic in our thinking while filtering information, we should also look out for surprises and information with a value that lasts.  When in doubt, seek the ultimate source of the information.  I generally rely heavily on search engines to keep my information portfolio diverse, such that when answers are not readily found through one option, there are more alternatives.  Hence, I tend to read more than I listen.  In developing our content filtering skills, we can demonstrate expertise, boost visibility, and build relationships.  Relationships are a double edged sword, because relationships formed using social media may take our attention and focus away from our goals.  In general, inbound information can either be considered requests for our time, our money, or our relationships.  To reduce these requests due to our limited time and memory, we will have to tighten our filtering.

Here is a list of my current information portals and tools, which is quite long, so it will be difficult to ascertain the proportion of my time spent on each category of information source, besides a general overview centred around Expertise and Identity, as I've shared when I did my self evaluation around the power of purpose:
