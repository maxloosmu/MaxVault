## Self Evaluation based on the 4th Power - The Power Of Attention And Routines

I'm doing this self evaluation on my application of the power of attention and its routines based on the book "Thriving on Overload: the 5 Powers for Success in a World of Exponential Information".

In current times, our goals are usually interfered with due to our brains' limited cognitive control and saturated information environment.  In general, we can't multitask, because when we "multitask", we are actually switching quickly between tasks, and that's costly and not effective.  Our brain has 6 attention modes where we pursue 6 distinct activities, where each activity is related to one attention mode and there is a dramatic mental cost to switching between attention modes.  The frequency of switching should be reduced to achieve effective information mastery.  Every transition is a distraction.  Habitual routines should be built around these attention modes aligned towards our purpose and goals.

Attention modes:
* Seeking Direction (Purposeful search for information)
* Exploring Serendipity (Open, curious adventuring and discovery)
* Scanning Discernment (Checking sources to identify relevant content)
* Assimilating Agility (Efficient integration into mental models)
* Deep-Diving Immersion (Intense concentration to comprehend and synthesise)
* Regenerating Relaxation (Disengaged from structured information)

Attention mode persistence strategies:
- while deep diving, we may get ideas outside of what we are immediately focused on: we should record the ideas, forget about them, and then refer to them later to decide what to do with them.
- while exploring, we identify a valuable resource: we should record the resource, and assimilate them later.
- while seeking specific information, we encounter fascinating information outside the direct relevance of what we seek: we should record the information, and explore them later.

Scanning efficiently:
- based on the power of filtering, inbound information for scanning is delivered.
- goal-oriented scanning or skimming over the inbound information requires discernment, which is a state of mind involving rapid decision making to identify relevant information.
- keep to the chosen information sources based on the power of filtering; if there's still too many, filter more.
- defined scans should be direct and completed before we start exploring beyond the chosen information sources; we should use search engines when we begin seeking or exploring.
- scanning time should be budgeted and constrained if possible.

My perspectives on scanning:
- I scan news headlines, emails, and messages based on my filtered sources and contacts to identify information relevant to my purposes when time is allocated for it, and record them down for assimilation later.
- I may assimilate immediately if fewer articles are identified, I'm expecting less information, or if I have the time to take a more relaxed, leisurely and exploration led approach.

Seeking clearly:
- seeking is just an application of scanning onto search engine results, where searches are conducted in defined directions.
- stay focused and avoid exploring when seeking.
- scan broadly by rephrasing search terms, and even using different search engines, or academic search engines such as Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, or ResearchGate when appropriate.
- when searching through papers, spiderweb into all the citations if time permits.
- after finding the relevant resources, scan through them quickly to determine if there's valuable information.
- if there's few valuable information in the resource, note the key ideas of interest and drop the resource.
- bookmark the more promising resources for future assimilation or deep-diving.

My perspectives on seeking:
- I usually confine my searches to the digital formats due to ease of search.
- while programming, I sometimes want to know how to express certain requirements or pseudocode in actual code based on a particular programming language, so I search/seek with a predefined objective before assimilating as part of the overall deep dive into programming.
- while debugging, I usually start the search for a solution with the error text, but sometimes, when the error text is not clear, I may have to do continuous seek-scan-assimilate triples of attention modes to improve my understanding of the error in order to find better answers, and concurrently test the suggested solutions to see if they work.

Assimilating at our own adjusted pace:
- our adjusted pace of assimilation of inbound information is dependent on how well we comprehend, frame and integrate the ideas we read about or listen to.
- time has to be set aside for the proper assimilation of content; we should not try to absorb everything we want to absorb that comes by.
- we have to be agile when assimilating information to extract value as efficiently as possible, because we may not yet know how much value is in the content we have acquired through scanning, and are reading further on.
- for effective integration of ideas into our frameworks and mental models, we should write notes although it's more time consuming.

To comprehend faster while assimilating:
- we should read effectively by expanding our visual field.
- we should take in more lines without moving our eyes left and right in one saccade, where our eyes fix on one location before moving to the next location, and where reducing line widths help.
- when extracting value from a book, we should read the introduction for a summary and the conclusion for a recap, and spend some time (about 15 min) to skim through the book to identify the overall content structure, arguments, and sections of interest.
- we can read faster if we are more familiar with the content, and will have to slow down to absorb interesting ideas.

Deep-Diving
- by default, our minds tend to constantly wander, so we need intent and will to dive deep.
- the purposes of deep-diving are to absorb content for true comprehension, discern patterns deliberately, identify new connections, and refine the structure of our frameworks.
- when we deep-dive, we do purposeful sense-making, explore perspectives, and lay the groundwork for effective decisions.
- deep-diving takes time and requires uninterrupted focus; thoroughly developing and questioning assumptions; synthesising all the data, information and knowledge that continuously come to us; making connections; bouncing ideas off people we trust; and iterating through multiple scenarios.
- for deep-diving, it is essential to allocate sufficient blocks of time, and to access the right frame of mind to be totally immersed.
- for deep-diving, we should create a space for work that is completely comfortable for extended periods of time, where ergonomics and lighting are suitable; eliminate all interruptions and distractions.
- when deep-diving, we should refresh with regular breaks using basic rest-activity cycle (BRAC) theory, or the Pomodoro technique, or whatever works best for us through experimentation.
- we may experiment with adding music to our deep dives to help us focus, because music can drown out background noise and help create a positive mood.

My perspectives on assimilation and deep-diving:
- my deep dives usually happen when I do programming, because to fulfill the program's requirements and to debug the problems arising, I need to scan, seek and assimilate content from the Internet and ebooks over extended periods of time.
- I am sometimes so addicted to and focused on deep diving, that I forget the time and sleep very late as I persist with constructing the program I am working with.
- it is sometimes similar when I do research and scan, seek and explore for content, because I can persist with these over long periods of time as I'm somewhat addicted to the success of finding content.
- however for research, I sometimes encounter difficulties with content comprehension when certain information is lacking or when the content is conceptually complex, so my assimilation and deep dives are sometimes affected.

Exploring and serendipity:
- exploring is about going into panoramic or peripheral vision, where we shift our focus and attention to the edges of our field of sight without moving our eyes, thereby disengaging our vigilance of attention and the tight visual focus we usually have, and thus, calming our nervous system and sometimes expanding our conceptual understanding due to the insights arising from this practice, which essentially minimises mental fixations.
- serendipity is more likely when we explore less commonly known information; when we keep diverting towards and following what we find interesting and use that as a new start of our exploration; when we use different search tools to search in different places; when we start our searches with an unusual and intriguing person, word or combination of words; or when we repeatedly give ourselves feedback while learning.

Regenerating:
- deep diving is about directing attention to information immersion, which is not sustainable due to "directed attention fatigue".
- attention restoration theory states that different environments, especially natural ones, can help our limited attention capabilities to regenerate due to environmental fascination, which is softer for natural environments because other thoughts can emerge and flow as we contemplate our environment.
- harder fascination arising from watching movies or sports events absorbs our attention and curtails thinking about other things.
- regenerative activities are highly conducive to synthesis and insights generation, where we pull back from task focused busyness to see the big picture, and generate new ideas, identify opportunities, or recognise where best to apply our efforts.

My perspectives on regenerating:
- I usually regenerate a little when my mind naturally starts exploring or wandering because other thoughts and ideas can pop up when I'm in any attention mode that I'm not fully addicted to.
- I sometimes read in different environments outside of home or work place, so panoramic influences can seep into my conscious attention, but this reduces the effectiveness of my attention because it's not fully directed.
- Most of my regeneration happens when I take breaks from the more intense attention modes of seeking, scanning, assimilating and deep diving.

### The importance of information routines

I would divide my daily tasks into several categories: administrative, reading, writing/coding, watching/listening, maintaining, and traveling.  However, the attention modes discussed thus far appear to be generally reading oriented.

For administrative tasks, which involve reading and answering emails and messages, printing and scanning documents, and organising my digital content and non-digital paperwork, I'm usually seeking to connect the dots and get things done.  This involves searches for, processing and organising of digital and non-digital files and folders.  This involves a "doing" mode of attention, which also requires a certain amount of focus and concentration to ensure that things get done properly.

My reading tasks are usually deep dives into programming languages and other research content.  For programming languages, reading is usually followed by the testing of the code.  Most of the time in the past, I try to assimilate without making notes, but I'm now making an effort to assimilate better through making notes because I don't remember very well and constantly rely on seeking by searching the Internet for answers.  I also do scanning of my seeked content, but in general, deep dives are required for research content as compared with programming content, because research content is usually more complex unless it's for self discovery and self improvement.  I may also need to explore for research content when the content becomes somewhat abstruse.  My occasional reading of news articles are usually quite regenerative with some assimilation because I try to see the big picture and spot relevant ideas or opportunities.

My writing tasks are for making notes, as well as for writing code.  For making notes, they involve assimilation and deep dives.  For writing code, they usually involve seeking, scanning, assimilating quickly and testing the code.  This happens usually in the context of a deep dive into writing programs to fit requirements or resolve issues.  I am also considering doing deep dives to improve the readability and understandability of existing code.

Watching and listening happens all the time, but I'm more focused on the online courses, which I take from time to time, and the online news media.  For online courses, which is usually about programming, I'll usually just try to assimilate the code through watching the demonstrations as part of a deep dive.  However, for programming languages that are relatively new or complex to me, such as Haskell, I'm planning to do some notes making as well.  When I watch the news content, it's just about assimilation, which may lead to the seeking, scanning and assimilating through reading of specific news articles of relevance to me.  Sometimes, I do watch videos relevant to research, and I do attend online meetings, and I try to assimilate the content with some notes making, although their complexity usually requires reading and comprehending more content.  Other forms of casual, but real life, watching and listening are usually for regenerative and exploratory purposes unless there is a need to communicate.  Exploration happens because information in life comes randomly, with occasional serendipity.

Maintaining is also a form of administrative task, but it's generally more physical, where I eat, drink, use the toilet, bathe, brush my teeth, and sleep.  Excepting sleep, they all require a "doing" mode of attention.  The process of trying to sleep is regenerative and meditative.  Traveling from place to place also requires a doing mode of attention when I'm physically trying to move.  However, once I'm seated on a bus, I'll switch to the regenerative and exploratory mode of attention because I don't read well on buses and usually just watch and listen if I have nothing to think about; and when I'm on a train, I'll usually read, which because of the environment I'm in, will be the seeking, scanning and assimilating modes of attention without deep diving.

In conclusion, I would say that my daily information routines usually revolve around the norms of work and life.  I'm not able to restructure my habitual patterns around finding the best times for effective application of modes of attention.  Also, based on this long analysis and my previous evaluations as of 16 December 2022, besides reading up about the fifth power of synthesis, I should also set aside time to read more into framing content, reading comprehension, and timeboxing.  These knowledge would be relevant for my research purposes.  I'm quite comfortable with my coding skills, but improvements to my remembering and naming of code (clean code), as well as agile time management, would be helpful for my long term growth as a programmer.  For this blog post, I assimilated the power of attention content from the book over a few days with notes taking.  It could also be considered deep diving because there was intense concentration and comprehension.  I then reread and amended the notes I made for better comprehension and integration.
