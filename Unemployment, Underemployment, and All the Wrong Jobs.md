## Unemployment, Underemployment, and All the Wrong Jobs

For this post, I have to dig into my past. I’m hopeful that my shared experiences will provide some insight into the requirements of the jobs I’ve tried, benefiting career newbies or career changers.

Today, although I work in the field of computational research, I’m basically more of a doer and analyser than creative and intuitive thinker. Fortunately, with time and a lot of learning from examples, intuition and creativity can arise although the answers, solutions or designs may be simple and at times, inadequate. The advantage of doing coding work is that software development is currently an iterative and agile process. Mistakes and inadequacies in the software are gradually corrected as development progresses.

As I’ve shared in my previous post, I had been unemployed for a good part of my working life as of now due to my medical conditions. Admin support roles and data entry jobs are in general quite suitable for me, but the pay is low. I’m also not a speed typist and I do make mistakes if I try to speed up in whatever tasks I do. These job roles exist in many companies, so these jobs will be a good start for anyone entering the workforce or sector. For graduates, taking on these types of jobs is considered underemployment.

Another role that I find suitable for me is logistics warehouse based roles, where we maintain the warehouse and do picking and packing when the orders arrive. This is a menial job when I tried this type of job before I acquired my disablity in 2011. However, this role also requires adequate trust and communication between colleagues. I did not have a fixed mindset while doing this type of job and could not fit into the work culture of the teams I worked with. I tried this type of job twice in my career. The pay is also low.

A job that I’ve tried that may not be very suitable for me is the position of security guard. In this job, I was rotated to different locations of the building I was assigned to, and basically watched the property and record the movement of people and vehicles. It is shift work lasting 12 hours per shift. The working hours are long, the pay is low, and at times, I had to control the people and vehicles on the property watched. Controlling people, including children, is not my forte.

Influencing people is not my forte too, so I do not work well in sales and customer service roles. In sales, connections have to be built to obtain possible sales opportunities, and hence requiring a lot of cold calls, networking and customer visits. Conflicts usually arise if profit margins are at an unsuitable level vis a vis competitor products. Retail sales is less demanding, but requires the handling of the higher footfall operationally.

My exposure to customer service extends from my experience as the contact point for corporate customers pre and post sales. I also had exposure to call centres. In general, if the products are of good quality and using the products is less complex, customers are usually less emotional and demanding. Emotional extremes are usually expressed by customers over the telephone when their problems could not be resolved. This usually happens because the product and problem is complex, and the customer service personnel was not trained in that particular area, and could not get help from more experienced personnel.

I also do not work well in purchasing roles less because of communication, and more because of the product because I had worked in a local restaurant. Working in a restaurant provides free lunches, but requires knowing the details of pre-cooked food. Usually, I have to communicate with the cooks to determine the food obtained are right for cooking, and then to keep records of all pre-cooked food quantity and their costs. My time as a purchaser ended when I did not attend a required company training due to my unsettled mind, likely caused by my undetected mental illness.

I work best in analysis and software testing and development work. Programming software is analogous to solving puzzles or answering mathematical or scientific questions. I have a lot of experience in handling puzzles and questions from my school days, so the tasks are more easily handled. There is much to be learned to apply the experiences and techniques specifically to the coding tasks, because we are using various programming or scripting languages and not maths and science. However, coding definitely provides me with a sense of accomplishment when the program is done.

I work well in research, but I know my limits in reading and memory work. Hence, I try to read the essentials or required content. I do not read all the content. There is an Internet acronym for this: TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read). Hence, I also rely heavily on using the Google Search Engine. Despite these, there’s still a lot of reading and learning required, because sometimes, there is much good and relevant content on the Internet or in papers and e-books. Ultimately, we must be sensitive to the funding requirements of the research, and try to achieve the research objectives.
