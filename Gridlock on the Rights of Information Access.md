We can see that we have four rights of information access.  Firstly, there's freedom of expression and information.  However, this goes against personal data protection.  We may not want our personal data to be shared.  Secondly, there's transparency of information.  This right is countered by laws of secrecy.  Thirdly, there's the openness of data, which is essentially what my post itself represents.  Anyone can re-use or redistribute it.  This is considered the impersonal form of the first right, so it goes against information security.  Finally, there's Public Sector Information (PSI), which is collared by intellectual property rights or more commonly known as copyrights.  This is the world of the legally defined good versus good in information access and distribution.  Clearly, one either chooses one side and moves on with life, or apathy sets in and one ignores everything about this gridlock.
