## Are we starved of time everyday?  What we can do about it.  Time, Gratitude, Satisfaction, Contentment, Purpose

"In studying how the world works we are studying how God works, and thereby learning what God is. In that spirit, we can interpret the search for knowledge as a form of worship and our discoveries as a revelation."

These are the words of Frank Wilczek, and I found them in the book "Importance of being interested.  Adventures in scientific curiosity".  However, my search for knowledge and wisdom brought me to another book "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals".  

4000 weeks is the estimated lifespan most of us will have on this planet.  This was contrasted with the infinitely many ambitious plans that we have no time to put into action.  We have many time management apps and productivity books now, but those solutions may lead to a nervous breakdown when we try to pack our schedule with too many tasks.  Are we using up our limited time in a way we'd rather not?  Are we finely honed, lean, mean production machines?  

Our current situation will have to be contrasted with what the famous economist John Maynard Keynes said in 1930 in a speech titled "Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren".  He predicted that within a century, the growth of wealth and advancement of technology will result in people working no more than about 15 hours a week: 

"Thus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem-how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well."

This did not materialise.  In our continuous efforts to keep up with making more money to meet our ever inflating needs and wants, busyness has become contagious.  In fact, the perceived busyness of those at the top of the economic ladder has entrenched them with inflated salaries, while those lower in the economic ladder received greater insecurity from lower salaries because of cut costs and efficiency improvements.  Otherwise, work is harder to come by.  Overarching all these is the fact that we live in an overpopulated world.  

Finding our way out of this predicament involves a few steps.  Firstly, we should have gratitude for whatever time we have now being alive, healthy and in control of our mental faculties.  

Secondly, we should spend our limited time and attention on what we deem important to us.  Having a purpose in life that we can take action on immediately would do the trick.  This purpose should enable us to develop task orientation, such that we work with the tasks important to us most of the time, and let the rhythms of life emerge organically from the tasks themselves.  We may plan these tasks in a schedule for a start, but try planning just a few tasks.  We should strive for not hearing the clock ticking as much as possible, and just respond to the needs of our place and moment in history.  

Lastly, we should derive satisfaction from what we do in alignment with our purpose and be contented with the outcomes.  After all, we are just one person in an ocean of life.  If we do not derive satisfaction and contentment in life, then we'll have to relook our life's purpose.  

In life, we have needs of survival which are generally based on money.  These will include eating and drinking and resting, and access to healthcare and work.  In addition to these needs would be wants, such as family and friends, and leisure, education and religion.  We may want to live in a safe and secure environment.  A purpose that meets most of these needs and wants in a suitable way will give us satisfaction and contentment in life.  

With respect to the amount of work we have to do, if we're overworked, we'll just have to start acknowledging that we'll never be able to finish everything.  If we try to master time, it will end up mastering us.  We cannot overcome busyness by being even more busy.  We'll have to stop procrastinating and make tough choices to reduce overworking.  Focus on only the things that count and be affirmed by our choices.  If we can imagine ourselves living on borrowed time, then the time we have available to spend on would be something we can be thankful for.  

We'll have to work with the finite life we are given and not beat ourselves up for our failures to do more.  We should only do what we can, in order to get our lives into proper working order.  Our joy and fulfilment in life should not depend on doing more than we can do.  More importantly, since we are finite working beings, our time is valuable.  

In general, understanding that our life is short will not make us happier, but we will become more real.  If we have to wait for death to reach us before we understand this, it may be too late.  For me, I was shaken from my stupor only after I became disabled from a suicide attempt arising from my mental illness.  I thank God for being alive to share this with you.  

I'll end this post with a list of phrases, statements or principles which will be helpful in managing your time or understanding the reality we live in.  I got them from the book "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals":
* Pay yourself first.
* Limit your work in progress.
* Resist the allure of middling priorities.
* Avoid paralysis due to perfectionism.
* Settle for a job that pays the bills.
* Do not be digitally distracted.
* There is discomfort in doing what matters.
* Any planned task will always take longer than expected.
* A mind-boggling number of events have happened, most outside of our control, to make us who we are today.
* A plan is just a thought.
* Don't be obsessed with chasing the future.
* Every moment in life is a last time.
* Capitalism is a giant machine that instrumentalises everything: we become human resources in service of future profit. 
* We have to find the real meaning for our existence now, do not postpone it into the future.
* Be in the present moment, do not only Try to live it.
* Take on more atelic activities.
* Beware the impatience/addiction spiral: are you getting anxious when you read long posts like this because it's taking too long to read? 
* Do not try to seize control over your experiences when reading or appreciating something - surrender to the speed of reality. 
* 3 principles of patience: develop a taste for problems, embrace radical incrementalism, originality lies on the far side of unoriginality.
* Besides patience, other temporal constraints to surrender to to find a deeper sort of freedom, is communal time and time for coordinated synchronous action. 
* Live a modestly meaningful life, do not overvalue our existence: we are cosmically insignificant. 
* Many things matter, but now is all we ever get.
* Try not to hope, just do it.

The book ends with 5 questions and 10 tools for embracing your finitude, which are quite helpful.  I'll leave it to you to get the book and read them.
