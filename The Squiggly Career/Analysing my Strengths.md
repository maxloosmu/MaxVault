## Analysing my Strengths

I'm doing this analysis based on a strengths determination exercise from the book "The Squiggly Career: Ditch the Ladder, Discover Opportunity, Design Your Career".  I did not follow the exercises completely, but I believe this should be sufficient for a good analysis of my strengths at work.  

Strengths = Natural Talent + Experiences

In work, we should seek to make a positive difference and find personal fulfilment.  This is centred around our strengths.  I'll start off this analysis by stating the natural talents I believe I have: I like learning, analytical and constructive work.  This is based on a quick analysis from:

Super Strengths:
I would choose learning and discipline because I've been learning throughout my life, through good times and bad times, and because of my medical problems, studies and work, I've had to be disciplined to create order in life.  In my current work, I learn everyday and my discipline shows over time as I refocus or reorganise my work.  

In the book, we are told to rate our talents on a scale from 1 to 10, for Success, Frequency, Openness and Happiness.  I'll just do this for what I now consider to be my Super Strengths.  

Learning:
I would rate success as 8 because when the concepts or skills are well explained or exemplified, I can learn quite fast.  I would rate frequency as 10, because I constantly use this strength.  I would rate openness as 10, because the work I do is available for all to see.  I also do weekly reports for reviews by my colleagues.  I would rate happiness as 8 because I do encounter difficult to understand topics, or insufficient or lack of examples in what I am learning.  What I do not understand usually leaves me less satisfied and less happy.  

Discipline:
I would rate success as 8 because I do weekly reports to maintain order in my work.  However, there are times when I have had too much to learn, and so I have had to rearrange my time to resolve issues in understanding.  I would rate frequency as 10, because I regularly use this strength.  I would rate openness as 7, because only my weekly emailed report to 2 of my colleagues will show the details of what I had to do and the discipline required.  The brief report I share during our weekly meetings may not show the details of what I've had to go through.  I would rate happiness as 7 because there are many times I've had to compromise on what I'm learning because the discipline in my time management because I'm usually short of time.
