## Determining my Current Values

I had selected 5 personal values to live on in:
https://medium.com/@maxloopinmok/applying-some-basic-minimalism-in-my-life-bf2175a28d19
* Gratitude: to express gratitude that there’s a God in my life
* Wisdom: to grow in wisdom
* Responsibility: to be responsible with what I do and say
* Contribution: to grow in contributions in work and life
* Openness: to be open with what I’ve learnt

I'm now doing this more detailed analysis based on the book "The Squiggly Career: Ditch the Ladder, Discover Opportunity, Design Your Career".  The first exercise is to reflect on my past career.  I had already done part of that here:
https://medium.com/@maxloopinmok/unemployment-underemployment-and-all-the-wrong-jobs-5f9ea40950

Career must-haves, which are centred around accomplishing these 3 factors:
* Work must accommodate my medical conditions
* Sufficient remuneration for my current and future needs, especially medical and livelihood costs
* Time to learn, grow and rest
My career must-nots are just the reverse of my career must-haves.

I'll skip the second exercise of spotting what is important to me because much of that is already in my career must-haves and in my previous values selection.

In the third exercise of scanning, I've selected these words below that are important to me from the list provided, and added perseverance:
- Acceptance
- Creativity
- Curiosity
- Determination
- Discipline
- Focus
- Freedom
- Growth
- Helpfulness
- Honesty
- Kindness
- Knowledge
- Learning
- Logic
- Loyalty
- Meaning
- Obedience
- Openness
- Peace
- Politeness
- Progression
- Purpose
- Rationality
- Respect for others
- Responsibility
- Spirituality
- Stability
- Tolerance
- Vision
- Wisdom
- Perseverance

In the fourth exercise of prioritising and organising into 10 sets of values, I must say that I'm not reflecting on what makes me happy at work, but what makes me satisfied and content.  This has been explained at:

And instead of 10 sets, I'll directly organise them to see if they fit into my 5 previously selected values:
* Gratitude: Acceptance/Freedom/Helpfulness/Honesty/Kindness/Openness/Peace/Politeness/Respect for others/Spirituality/Resilience
* Learning: Learning/Curiosity/Wisdom/Vision/Purpose/Meaning/Knowledge/Creativity/Growth/Progression
* Responsibility: Discipline/Focus/Logic/Loyalty/Obedience/Rationality
* Contribution: Determination/Tolerance/Perseverance
* Stability

Gratitude comprises 11 values related to the presence of God in my life, including my previously selected value of openness and an additional value resilience, which is also one of my strengths.  I've decided that Learning should be my next value, and it comprises 10 related values, including wisdom.  My third value Responsibility comprises 6 values, because it takes focus and discipline, and it is both logical and rational to be responsible.  Contribution requires determination, perseverance and tolerance of inadequacies at work and in life.  My last value of stability may be considered optional, because after going through so much in life, I've discovered that there is no stability even though I would prefer to keep that as my value.

And finally, in the last exercise defining, I realised that I have to select and define the top 4 values, and I've already done that.

My 4 finalised values are:
* Gratitude
* Learning
* Responsibility
* Contribution

Since the place where I did this analysis is considered important by the book, I must add that I did this at home.  On the whole, my current personal values build upon my super strengths as identified in:
