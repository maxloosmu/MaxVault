I write this article referencing the book "The Twelve Habits of Smart Skill-Building.  A code for the reselling of you" by Bala Shankar.  I'll focus on just a few habit patterns that I find most relevant to me.  In computational research, besides using my skills, I find that I usually spend much of my time learning new knowledge, refreshing my memory, learning new skills or enhancing existing skills.  I learn by doing, so I code and blog when I learn.  It is all a combination of work, leisure and spiritual for me.

The first habit pattern I feel that is more relevant is a set of two: Diagnosis and Synergising.  Here's a list of my existing skills:

- Use computers, smartphones and the Internet
- Answer general, mathematical and scientific questions
- Writing, typing and blogging
- Do programming and scripting
- Solve puzzles and problems using learnt solutions
- Applying intuitive and insightful creativity to tasks where possible
- Do risk analysis by researching on things that may go wrong
- Learn new theories and concepts
- Reasoning to keep faith in our Maker

I did not break down or rearrange each of these categories of skills into core, component or sub-skills because it does not seem relevant or practical to work out the multitude of details, but it would be relevant to mention some aspects of my personality vis a vis my skills: analytical, systemic, investigative, diligent.  In terms of intelligence, I would rate myself as not so bright, and that's the reason why I read a lot and tend to forget much too.  The common thread running through all my skills is that they all involve sequences, whether they are code sequences, language sequences, routine sequences or process sequences.  This could be consider the synergy across all my skills, although fusing the skills will be too difficult because they belong to different domains of knowledge, language and technology.

The next habit pattern is actually a set of three referred to separately in the book as: learning on the go, time smart, and action smart.  The aspects relevant to me include start simple without over intellectualising, finding utility in new but related skills, be flexible to make changes to learning, self teaching and motivation, prioritising time and commitment to learning without multitasking or deadlines if both distract or constrain more than help, learning by doing, and be open to judgements and tests.

The last relevant habit pattern is again a set of three referred to as: managing disruption, trying, and being agnostic.  The aspects relevant to me are: finding utility in the new domains, circumstances and knowledge, analyse, learn and retry by skill-activity adjustment, goal redefinition, and correcting and redoing with a positive attitude after failure, and not being lulled by success.

Learning new skills cost time and effort.  Ultimately, it will have to be balanced by the opportunity cost of not having those new skills.  This involves a certain element of foresight and a recognition of personal limits in learning abilities.
