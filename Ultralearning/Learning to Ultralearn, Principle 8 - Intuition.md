## Learning to Ultralearn, Principle 8 - Intuition

Principle 8 of the book “Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career” is "Intuition, Dig Deep Before Building Up".  Based on an analysis of the physicist Richard Feynman's way of thinking, the book stated a few rules and a technique of comprehension.  The general overarching rule is to focus on the deeper principles of what we are learning about, but in order to do that, we'll need experience with what we are learning about.  This leads to Rule 1: "Don't Give Up on Hard Problems Easily" and Rule 2: "Prove Things to Understand Them".  We should try to be more obsessed with solving problems, and to solve them at a fundamental level, so that we can understand the underlying principles.  When we prove things, we should try to reconstruct the thing and recreate the results, so that they can be demonstrated, even if it is more time consuming.  This leads to Rule 3: "Always Start with a Concrete Example".  

In trying to create the concrete example, we will also be giving ourselves feedback on how well we understand the thing, and in such cases, the thing usually refers to concepts.  Our understanding of concepts is usually more difficult to ascertain as compared to our understanding of facts.  Hence, when we learn concepts, we must also be aware of Rule 4: "Don't Fool Yourself".  When we lack knowledge about a subject, we sometimes do not know what we do not know, so we do not know any better about how to assess ourselves.  To avoid fooling ourselves, the book recommends for us to try asking more questions.  Sometimes when we ask seemingly obvious questions, we will notice the not-so-obvious implications of what we are studying.  Creating concrete examples also shapes how we think about what we are studying while we pay attention to it, and it is not just about how much time we spend learning it.  This is known as the levels-of-processing memory effect.  

Principle 8 ends with the Feynman Technique, which the author created for us to develop intuition on the ideas we are trying to learn:
* write down the concept we are trying to learn or problem we are trying to solve.  
* if it's a concept, write down explanations to teach the concept to someone new to the concept.
* if it's a problem, write down explanations on how to solve the problem, as well as elaborate on why the solution makes sense to us.  
* if we get stuck because our understanding fails to provide a clear answer, we should refer back to our sources of information and knowledge.  

There are 3 applications for the Technique.  Application 1: 
- When we don't understand something completely, the easiest way to build our understanding is to refer continuously to our source of information while we write.  This may not help us remember the concept, but it should improve our understanding of the concept.  

Application 2:
- When we need to solve a difficult problem or master a technique, we'll need to go through the problem or technique step by step and write down the explanation accordingly.  We should not try to summarise the explanation because if we summarise, we may unknowingly skipped certain core explanations that are important to solving the difficult problem.  Writing everything may take time, but we can understand and remember the steps better.  

Application 3:
- When we need to greatly improve our intuition for a concept we are learning, instead of explaining all the details or referring continuously to our source materials, we should try to generate illustrative examples, analogies or visualisations.  This will definitely help others who know far less than us comprehend what we are learning.
