## Self Evaluation Around the Power of Purpose Based on the Book "Thriving on Overload"

I'm doing this self evaluation around my purpose using the book "Thriving on Overload: the 5 Powers for Success in a World of Exponential Information".  My current life purpose is centred around earning enough for my current and future livelihood and medical expenditures.  Hence, I would breakdown my purpose into 2 main parts instead of the possible 6 parts.  Expertise takes up 70% and identity 20%, while I'll portion 5% each to well-being and society.  These proportions are estimates of the time spent on them, with less emphasis on monetary and relationship contributions.  

At the moment, I'm more focused on being more T-shaped in my Expertise, where I try to develop more depth into web development with a balance between its frontend and backend skills, and the OOP and FP paradigms.  The horizontal breadth of the T will come from occasional readings into the industry and business I'm in, which is the legal and AI industry.  Due to the nature of the business, the work I do can also be seen as a contribution to Society.  I would not make multi-year forecasts about my expertise, because I'm working in a small country in the technology industry, so job requirements can change very fast.  

Similarly, although my purpose consists of 20% Identity, where I currently spend about 20% of my time doing self discovery and improvement, this category of purpose also contributes to my Well-Being, specifically, my mental health.  Currently, my Passions centre around my work and self, so this purpose category is subsumed into Expertise and Identity.  I am not much of a risk taker, so I do not spend time on the Ventures purpose category.
