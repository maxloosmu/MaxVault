## Applying Some Basic Minimalism in my Life

After my analysis of time in my previous post:
https://medium.com/@maxloopinmok/are-we-starved-of-time-everyday-what-we-can-do-about-it-f2fc9d75ce5e

My mind was drawn towards the idea of minimalism.  My current self analysis follows from the book "Simplify: A Start-up Guide to Minimalism" from "Simplicity: Finding Joy Through A Minimalist Lifestyle (4 Books in 1 Minimalism Bundle)".

As of now, I can identify 5 personal values to live on:
* Gratitude: to express gratitude that there's a God in my life
* Wisdom: to grow in wisdom
* Responsibility: to be responsible with what I do and say
* Contribution: to grow in contributions in work and life
* Openness: to be open with what I've learnt

My goals or purposes in life are simple:
* Simplify life so that I can be effective at work so that I can earn enough to live properly.
* Ensure that my personal values are satisfied.

These are my space decluttering tasks:
* donate away books i no longer need
* trash/recycle papers and electronic devices i no longer need
* relocate holders and containers of trashed papers and devices

Space decluttering requires decision making skills:
* choose books relevant to my needs
* replace older books with ebooks that may be updated

This is my time decluttering analysis:
* schedule around priorities of need, importance and immediacy
* practise routine time segmentation: before lunch, hours in office, going home period, after dinner

My time decluttering analysis follows and adds to my previous analysis:

My relationships are simple.  I have few family members, relatives, friends, colleagues, and one God.  My finances are quite simple too.  I pay for only what is needed, such as food, clothes, transport, medicals, books, cleaners, insect control, technology requirements, and utilities and conservancies.  Unfortunately, I also have to pay a larger sum of money every month for my father's stay in a nursing home due to his dementia.
