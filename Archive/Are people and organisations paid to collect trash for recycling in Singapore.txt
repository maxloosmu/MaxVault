## Are people and organisations paid to collect trash for recycling in Singapore?  Why isn't there Nuclear Energy in Singapore?  

I'm responding again to the Forward Singapore initiative.  

Having read this:

I believe Singapore already has more plans in place to recycle waste, in the form of having customers to pay more upfront for the items they buy, and then returning the recycling payment to them if they help with the waste sorting process by disposing of the trash in the right equipment in the right locations.  My question would be: shouldn't our Karang Guni men be doing this for us?  They seem to have all disappeared after the COVID crisis.  I'm asking this as a disabled person, who finds it tiring to walk around using my walking stick and carrying stuff to multiple locations for disposal.  

With regards to Clean Energy, building and relying on regional power supply energy grids are not reliable.  Nuclear Fission can be done and recycled safely in the mild climate of Singapore, and it's possible underwater.  Shouldn't Singapore be planning more quickly for this:

This was my previous contribution to the Forward Singapore discussion about Inequality in Singapore:

Dear DPM Lawrence Wong, I'm from Gen X and this is my Forward Singapore contribution.  I've shared a summary of my views and readings at:

The consequences of inequality are stark.  I have friends who have done very well in well paid leadership roles offering bubbles of hope.  I have friends at the bottom because of their medical conditions, to the extent that most are not working and some spend time idling in air-conditioned shopping malls and sometimes enjoy having curry puffs for lunch.  Housing prices are ridiculously high due to hyper competition for public and private housing.  There is inflation, but prices do not come down.  Cheap goods are usually of inferior quality.  Jobs are an unpredicatable monetary sustenance.  Transport, food and air-conditioned places are overcrowded.  Only the rich will consider making babies.  Those with borderline wealth will suffer if they start families unless they have privileged circumstances, such as flexible well paying jobs, supportive families and friends, and obedient kids.  Although I'm an engineering graduate from NTU, I do not plan to start a family because I've struggled with health and employment issues for much of my life.  As a Christian, I pray for God to take me home to Heaven soon, away from all my worldly troubles.  Please support euthanasia.
