## Gaining Insights, what I've learnt from the book "Seeing What Others Don't" with a brief example from the real estate sector and my programming experience

In life, we are often called to make less mistakes, to reduce errors in what we do.  This is relevant as individuals or in groups or organisations.  However, when we attempt to reduce errors and make less mistakes, such as through the Kaizen or Six Sigma frameworks, or a pursuit of holiness, we may become blind to alternative solutions, interpretations or outcomes.  Insights are reduced, which may affect our relevance or survival or performance, depending on the situation, because insights can change the way we do things or even our goals.  

To start, we can refer to a book written by Graham Wallas called "The Art of Thought", where he outlined a model of insight: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.  Wallas was a Christian who became a socialist and joined the Fabian Society.  He was also a psychologist.  In his model, preparation involves systematic, conscious, but fruitless analysis of a difficult problem.  Incubation involves mental relaxation and distance from the problem analysis to allow the unconscious mind to work freely.  Illumination involves a sudden burst of joyful insight.  Verification involves testing the insight's validity against the problem.  

In the book "Seeing What Others Don't: The Remarkable Ways We Gain Insights", Gary Klein, also a psychologist, rewrote Wallas' model, which includes elaborating on the mystical illumination process.  He first mentioned a form of intuitive decision making: recognition-primed decision strategy.  It was the evaluating and making of rapid intuitive decisions based on learnt patterns.  He used that as a basis for his naturalistic decision making examples of insights generation or discovery of new patterns, which are stories by different people in different settings.  Stories organise the situational details and expose dependencies on core beliefs or anchors, which are relatively stable and anchor the situational interpretation.  The actual anchors can change as more information is obtained.  Based on the stories, he extracted and created five strategies for gaining insights: connections, coincidences, curiosities, contradictions, and creative desperation.  

The connection strategy involves exposure to more ideas or information, and then linking and connecting the relevant ideas to new ideas that results in an intuition or insight.  This fits quite well with Wallas' model if the outcome is just an insight, but in reality, there could be many possibilities as insightful outcomes.  Hence, although the majority of Klein's stories were tagged with the connection strategy, most stories were in fact a blend of different tags.  

The coincidence strategy involves noticing coincidences, trends or irregularities, which are seemingly related ideas or events that occur repeatedly, but have no obvious causal links.  This involves deciding on whether the coincidences are accidental or chance occurrences, or if they provide an early warning or revelation of deeper patterns or dangers.  

The curiosity strategy involves noticing and evaluating a special idea or event that stands out based on the expertise of the person noticing the idea or event.  The advantages of examining curiosities is that it involves a one off evaluation that may or may not lead to an insight.  Examining coincidences may take more time and may mislead us with its repetitive occurrences.  We may be too sensitive to associations and see connections which aren't real.  Hence, having the background and expertise to test and evaluate the coincidence or curiosity is important.  

The contradiction strategy is expressed as doubts about the rightness of an idea, that something is seriously wrong with it.  It requires having a more skeptical mindset rather than the open mind of the coincidental and curiosity strategy.  Whether it is the coincidence, curiosity or contradiction strategy, they all involve reacting to data inconsistencies or anomalies through tests and evaluations without the illusion of knowledge, which means that we should not let our preconceived understandings stop us from making alternative or contradictory insights based on the coincidence, curiosity or contradiction, because these inconsistencies or anomalies are signs of incompleteness in our existing knowledge.  The illusion of knowledge usually arises from existing data that seem complete before the test and evaluation, but have shown to be incomplete as new information is known based on the coincidence, curiosity or contradiction.  

Before discussing the final creative desperation strategy, Klein's example highlighting the importance of these 4 previous strategies should be mentioned: the US subprime mortgage crisis of 2007â€“10.  This was spotted by different people from different walks of life, using a combination of these 4 strategies, but with the primary strategy being contradiction.  The contributing factors to this crisis was the earlier expansion of mortgage credit to people who may not be credit worthy, and over-speculation in the market.  This experience could be brought to bear on housing crises affecting other countries in the world, including the current mortgage crisis in China.  

The creative desperation strategy is similar to Wallas' illumination stage and was the primary research direction in insight research.  It is deliberate and happens when people are stuck and need breakthroughs without going through steady analysis.  It requires reexamining and dropping of preconceived assumptions, while actively searching for insights in sometimes life threatening situations.  

Klein closes off his investigation into insights by evaluating his five strategies from a data analysis, scientific literature, and stories points of view.  Using the naturalistic method arising from the stories, he formulated his Triple Path Model as shown here:



My experience in computational research usually involve the connection path, where I read up on research materials or learn programming or scripting languages, and the creative desperation path, which happens when I'm doing the actual coding of a program, and cannot find answers to my problems using Google.  A prime cause of all my problems in coding is that I usually tried to code efficiently, but most of the time, all I need to do is code effectively.  This usually means more lines of code which need to be rendered readable and recall-able.  My experience with the contradiction path usually comes when I read the news and the corresponding comments on the news.
