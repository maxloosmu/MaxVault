## Some Distilled Notes About How to Learn Fast and Acquire Skills, With an Example Application of Web Development

Saying that we want to learn fast can be interpreted as saying we want to comprehend better and faster, and remember more.  The notes here lists all the ideas relevant to accomplishing that, but it must be noted based on personal experience that speed reading should be applied on information we can digest more easily due to familiarity and redundancy, or if we are searching and scanning for answers to questions in our minds.  When the ideas read are new or unique, or if there are relevant details, we should slow down and read with more care and attention.  

Speed reading:
Read faster by scanning readings for answers to questions.  Try not to read a sentence more than once.  Do not read word for word if possible.  Try to identify key words and information.  Try to skim or speed read if topics are familiar, or if textual structure is identified and we can zoom in on the relevant sections.  

Learn in a variety of ways: 
Make and read notes, read books, use Google Search, do research, watch videos, create mind maps, use flash cards, blog, create and answer questions and solve problems to test ourselves, use mnemonics when there's too much seemingly unrelated information without patterns, read out while learning, associate newly learnt info with what we know, simplify-summarise-compress information, multi-learn only related topics, do not multitask other tasks with learning tasks.  

Make learning plans: 
Write down worries, study by interleaving a few related topics each day, make spaced repeated reviews and recollections of the same or closely related topics over days and weeks with reinforcement, plan breaks or rewards for accomplishments and deadlocks, do not be distracted by comparisons and outcomes, or by electronic devices or people around us, set goals and milestones to enjoy the discovery, improvement and mastery process.  

Learning pointers:
Be ready and humble to unlearn.  Set an ultimate learning goal based on current personal values, and be resilient and persevere towards accomplishing it.  Be self aware and know our personal strengths to guard against emotional stress.  Find meaning in or be involved with what we learn.  Keep calm and be relaxed and alert while learning.  Chunk learning by keeping sentence lengths to 7 in our distilled summaries if possible.  Notes or blogs supported by learning goals tell a story with expected or secured outcomes.  Learn usable knowledge and skills for greatest repeated recalls.  Harmonise the rhythms of learning to expand our conscious perception.  

Try to learn even if we cannot comprehend the information or skill at the beginning.  Recognition of confusion is a form of clarity.  Comprehension emerges from experience.  The more we figure things out, the faster we learn.  Identify mental models to help understand concepts, and mental hooks - analogies and metaphors to help memorise the concepts.  Learn new concepts by imagining the opposite or inverse of what we want.  Talk to experienced practitioners to help frame and set expectations.  Set up learning patterns, routines or habits, reinforced by checklists or scaffolds that structure approaches to performing skills.  Make and test predictions based on experiments: making observations, identifying knowns, making hypotheses and doing tests.  Record the outcomes.  

More learning pointers:
Spend some time on mental practices: brain games, practise Higher Order Thinking Skills, think critically, be practical, be creative, constantly engage our minds.  Learn in conducive places that are quieter and well lighted with good air quality, and in a comfortable study position or posture.  

Eat, hydrate, and rest and sleep sufficiently.  Some foods to take will include: blueberries, chicken, eggs, salmon, sardines, mackerel, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, dark chocolate, almonds, walnuts.  Supplements to take: choline, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins B, E, K, D, folate, flavonols, probiotics.  There should be adequate protein intake.  

Acquiring skills:
Acquiring a skill requires practice, which involve significant periods of sustained, focused concentration, and the creativity, flexibility and freedom to experiment and set personal learning goals.  Learn to plan, self-edit and self-correct as we practise in context.  If there's time, train and improve the acquired skill through repeated skill application.  Practice must be focused, persistent and intelligent.  

Rapid skills acquisition involves:
* deconstructing a skill into the smallest possible sub-skills.
* learn enough about each sub-skill to practise well.
* remove physical, mental and emotional obstructions to practice.
* practise the most important sub-skills for at least 20 hours

Acquiring skills involve 3 stages:
* Early cognitive stage - understand what we want to do, and research and 
think about the process to break the skill into manageable parts or tasks.  
* Intermediate associative stage - practise the task and observe feedback from environment to adjust our approach to practise.  
* Late autonomous stage - perform the skill effectively and efficiently without thinking or paying unnecessary attention to our actions.  

10 principles to rapidly acquire skills:
* choose to start a useful, lovable problem or project to be excited about and temporarily obsess over.  
* focus our energies on one skill or sub-skill at a time.  
* set a target level of performance based on our goals.  
* deconstruct the skill and focus on critical sub-skills.
* try to get the best critical tools, components or environment.  
* reduce and eliminate obstructions to practise arising from resources, the environment, and internal thoughts and emotions.  
* plan and dedicate time to practise.  
* quicken performance feedback from our practice.  
* practise in short bursts regularly, including using the clock to time our practices.  
* practise more and at a quicker pace while maintaining good form, not perfection.  

Additional considerations:
* start to practise as quickly as possible, and if possible, immerse ourselves in the practice.  
* reactivating or reacquiring a skill takes less time.  
* not all principles may apply when acquiring different skills.  

Learning process for developing web pages: 
* List down what we know about programming.
* Create mental models and hooks (input-process-output process flowchart with conditionals).
* List possible problems (program crashes unexpectedly, data is lost, bugs are created).
* List solutions (create exceptions to preempt program crashes, backup data, debug program).
* Identify core concepts (programming syntax: variables, conditionals, exceptions).
* Plan the program using Pseudocode.
* Choose programming approach based on available tools.
* Distinguish between programs that run locally and remotely on a web server.
* Plan development process (local programming and testing, and then deploying at remote server).
* Deconstruct and identify core concepts for web applications (fields, state, cookies, databases) and their metaphors (information, set of information, books, libraries).
* Research on a few major websites for web development (Stack Overflow, Hacker News) to choose programming language and frameworks - libraries of existing code, and possibly databases.
* Use Google to search websites specifically for what we need to avoid information overload.
* Search GitHub and the Internet for code examples, preferably usable or modifiable, after selecting programming language and framework for learning purposes and to reuse available code to avoid duplication, thereby enabling faster development.
* Obtain critical tools for web development.
* Experiment with the tools, read reference books and websites, and develop the web application.
* Feedback from coding programs is fast, enabling faster development and debugging.  
* If we do not understand the errors and warnings in the feedback, we can search the Internet for explanations.  
* Revise the web application as needed in a build-test-fix approach upon hitting unresolvable bugs or unknowns during development and testing.  
* Version control using GitHub.

needing some stretching in certain skills.
our unique innate skills will help us reach our goals.
do not be distracted by comparisons.
we have a constant uncontrollable need to learn.
needs are to be satisfied, wants are to be gratified.  
Learning is natural, but wanting to improve learning is optional and we have to be willing to practise to improve our comprehension and memory.
things we intend to learn are sometimes not as interesting as what we already know.  
our pride may lead us to the wrong reasons for a lack of improvement in learning.  
have the humility to unlearn and the positivity to not be discouraged by learning difficulties. 
have an ultimate goal to support efforts to improve our learning ability.
concentrate: be aware of, and list and eliminate distractions to get sense of accomplishment and motivation to be more self-aware in improvement journey.
be also self aware against emotional stress by knowing personal strengths to keep anxiety at bay.  
enjoy the discovery process and be a stress free learner.
goals and milestones in learning journey are important to make learning the means to an end, a form of reward, or even by considering learning as the end by enjoying the discoveries, improvements, and mastery of what we are learning.
memorisation and comprehension are different from each other.
reading and listening are also different.  

Strategies for boosting memory and comprehension:
book suggests eating well: vegetables, brain supplements like vitamin D, probiotics.
book also suggests sleeping well and exercising.
book suggests:
concentrate and do one task at a time.  multitasking leads to short term memory.
study in quiet, conducive places with enough lighting and good air quality.
make notes while reading.  
read out loud several times as a modified way of reading.  
study in groups.
play brain games.
be aware of multiple intelligences. 
training our Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) will improve our analysis, comprehension and memory.  
think critically, be practical, be creative, all to keep our brain actively functioning.  
use mnemonics to remember overwhelming amounts of information that lacks pattern and are seemingly unrelated.  
use repetition to improve memory.
