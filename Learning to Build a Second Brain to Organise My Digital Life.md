## Learning to Build a Second Brain to Organise My Digital Life

I wrote this post by distilling and summarising Parts One and Two of the book "Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential" by Tiago Forte.  

Our current media context is about novel and public information.  We would keep a personal notebook to relate to timeless and private information.  In life, we would preferably adopt a more patient, thoughtful approach to consume less information, emphasising rereading, reformulating, and working through the implications of ideas over time.  This reduces attention fragmentation and supports Systematic Inventive Thinking:

A digital "commonplace book" is a personal digital notebook (PDN), also considered our Second Brain, for study, journaling, organising, and idea generation.  A PDN should last a lifetime of learning and growth.  It is for developing and refining our thinking before sharing with others.  It supports the skills of knowledge workers: idea generation, problem solving, and effective communication. 

In the working world, note taking objectives are sometimes not clear, our notes may be used any time and in any way, our notes can be referred to at any time if we have them with us, and we are expected to take action on what we have noted, not just read or write about them.  Our notes can be of any length and in any format.  They can be copied, modified, or generated originally.  They are discrete knowledge building blocks that have individual value, and can also be combined to build reports, arguments, proposals or stories.  They can be rapidly searched, retrieved, moved, or reassembled without reinventing from scratch.  

Key benefits of PDN: 
* making our ideas digitally concrete
* enabling creativity by revealing relationships, associations and connections between ideas
* avoid recency bias by accumulating and incubating our ideas over time
* build up and sharpen our unique perspectives 
* avoid the emotional reactivity loop of urgency, outrage and sensationalism by keeping ideas at an objective distance outside our heads

PDN apps may have multimedia, are informal scribblings, are open-ended and meant to freely explore before setting goals, and are action-oriented to quickly capture stray thoughts while working on another task.  They are for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), where facts and ideas are digitally remembered so that they can be connected and thought upon by us, and possibly reassembled and built upon to create something new, concrete and shareable.  

The book suggests 4 steps (CODE) in remembering what matters in PKM:
* Capture: keeping only the ideas and insights that are noteworthy and resonate with us.  
* Organise and save for actionability based on the utility of the ideas, in alignment with current goals and priorities.  
* Distill our notes and find their essence in order to speed up association between ideas.  
* Express by eventually sharing our ideas, stories and knowledge with others.

CAPTURE
My favourite problems for capturing answers to:
* how do I remember more and comprehend better and faster? 
* how do I deal with and learn from the overwhelming quantity of relevant information available?  
* how will I plan for a future with multiple medical conditions?  
* what are the information most relevant to my current work?  
* will I be able to get a well paying job when I become jobless?  
* should I find a life partner or stay single?  
* is an overpopulated, unequal and conflict ridden world beset with problems a good place to start a family?  

We should try to capture inspiring, useful, personal, and surprising ideas.  Habitual patterns such as reading should be effortless and satisfying or enjoyable.  

ORGANISE
Organise stored notes and files around 4 categories: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive (PARA).  Projects are what we are currently working on, with clear start and end events.  They include projects at work, personal projects, and ad hoc side projects.  They are all immediately actionable.  Areas are responsibilities we're committed to over a longer duration, and can include work and personal areas that are not immediately actionable.  Resources are topics or interests that may be useful for future reference, so they are actionable depending on the situation.  Archives are for things from the previous 3 categories that are completed, put on hold, or ended due to change in commitment or relevance, so they are usually inactive.  

Notes and ideas should be organised according to where they are going in meeting our goals.  A piece of knowledge is valuable not because it's perfectly organised, but because it has an impact on the things and people around us.  Move quickly and touch lightly when organising our PDN to avoid turning the organising task into another heavy obligation.  Organise our favourite questions for capturing knowledge and identify past, present and future information needs, as well as information needs that are part of bigger projects.  These information needs are based on PARA tasks.  

DISTILL
Notes taking is about distilling ideas and preserving them for future use.  Progressive summarisation happens when we cut and paste chunks of text, bold the essentials, then distill the essentials by selectively highlighting or underlining them.  We end by providing an executive summary in bullet points written in our own words at the top of the note.  Summarise notes when we know it's worth it.  Try to improve notes whenever we read them, so that the most frequently reviewed notes will be most discoverable.  Judgements and decisions are made when summarising notes.  

Distilling, or being succinct without missing key details, also improves our daily conversations.  Summaries that are more easily discoverable are important for our future self because time is limited.  When work comes in future, our present research should support that work, thereby reducing the time spent on future research.  Making consistent progress with our notes is satisfying.  Creativity usually emerges from our daily efforts to gather and organise the influences on our thoughts and emotions.  

EXPRESS
We should not wait until we have everything ready before expressing or sharing our work or what we know.  Expressing our ideas earlier, more frequently, and in smaller chunks enables testing of what works.  Feedback can also be gathered to start the next cycle of the creative process.  

Divide a work task into smaller steps called intermediate packets to resolve task problems or difficulties.  Types of intermediate packets: 
* distilled notes
* material or ideas that were excluded from, that were part of, or were final deliverables from past projects
* documents and ideas created by others

We should always cite our sources and give them credit for their material and ideas.  Focusing on sub-tasks reduces interruptions and distractions from other parts of project, and can fit into the shorter spans of time we have available.  Regular feedback can be obtained for each sub-task completed to ensure that the deliverable is rightly built up.  In addition, these many intermediate packets of work can also be reassembled or reused in new projects.  While we can look for new material and ideas to create new intermediate packets, it is better to notice the packets we already have and CODE them more effectively.  

There is no single or perfectly reliable method of getting ideas from our notes, so creativity is unpredictable.  To retrieve notes from our device or app, we can use their search function, manually navigate the PARA folder system, rely on tags on our notes, or just rely on serendipity.  Retrieval serendipity takes a few forms: search beyond the folder that matches our search criteria, look through several relevant distilled notes, use visual patterns where possible, or rely on feedback after sharing our ideas with others.  

To truly know something after reading about them, we have to put them into action, otherwise they are just thoughts of ideas.  We apply the knowledge and learn by building concrete things before we are completely ready or have things figured out.  We may not even know where it's going.  As we express our ideas and turn knowledge into action, we'll change and learn more and think differently.  We share so that our ideas can make a difference to others and unlock our full creative potential.
