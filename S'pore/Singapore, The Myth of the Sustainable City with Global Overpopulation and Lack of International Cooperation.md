## Singapore, The Myth of the Sustainable City with Global Overpopulation and Lack of International Cooperation

Having read this article:

It would seem that the leaders of my country Singapore had made the right decision to accept independence of a small island nation, which developed into a city state.  After all, with our geographical position, existing international business and geo-political connections, on-going developments in science and technology, and a national will to succeed in a land given to us, all Singapore has to do is to fit into the regional and global economy and progress will come national project by national project.  More than 50 years on, my country's existence is not shaken, but its sustainability definitely is.

Firstly, there's the problem of climate change or global warming due to carbon emissions.  For Singapore, rising sea levels and hotter days are now a reality.  Are we able to cooperate internationally to stop or slow development to reduce global emissions?  Based on my reading of the news, developing countries such as India and China will not want to slow down development.  Rich nations in the American and European continents will have to consume large amounts of energy to stay warm during the winter season, and their people will still need to drive around.  And all these are premised on the one single factor causing it all, overpopulation.

Overpopulation is arguably behind almost all of our current global problems.  The inability to control our sexual urges before and after marriage is the root cause.  This root cause is sometimes justified by national, cultural or religious reasons.  For me, it took me a suicide attempt and my resulting disability to kill off that urge.  Some would argue that cities are built to manage large population sizes.  However, cities require vast aggregations of resources to build.  After the building of the city, they will have to be upkept and renewed to avoid structural accidents in the infrastructure.  This may mean demolishing and rebuilding infrastructure.  With changes in technology and threats such as pandemics, weather, earthquakes and climate change, more infrastructure will have to be renewed.  In addition, cities are food and energy intensive.  This combination of resource usage intensity will cause cities to fail unless there is adequate international cooperation.

Unfortunately, we currently are in the uneviable position of rising conflicts in the world.  Russia is waging war in Ukraine, while China is threatening that on Taiwan.  In addition, China and US relations have deteriorated to the extent that they have stopped exchanges on resolving the climate crisis:

In Singapore, the land that has been “given” to us in 1965 is now becoming very expensive to maintain. It is a fact known among some residents in our country that we are only renters of our property if the property is a HDB flat, because it is only leased to us for 99 years. The rise in the cost of living can only be compensated by an increase in wages, but that will lead to rising inflation unless there is continual and sufficient increase in productivity. And how are people supposed to keep on improving their productivity? We are not robots designed with different levels of speed or productivity that can continually be increased. While we in Singapore may be able to organise more productively, use technology, or import more cheap labour, all have limits and side effects primarily because we have limited land and brains. While there may be a lot of hype especially during national celebrations over our achievements since independence, we are literally passing on the costs and problems of independence onto our next generation. The only global benefit I can see from this is the reduced birth rate, which will eventually lead to a reduced population size, thereby resolving the problem of overpopulation vis a vis the world.
