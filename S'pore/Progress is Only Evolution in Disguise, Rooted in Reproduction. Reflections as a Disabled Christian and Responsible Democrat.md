## Progress is Only Evolution in Disguise, Rooted in Reproduction. Reflections as a Disabled Christian and Responsible Democrat

I'll write about the essentials of life in general in this post.  It's my contemplation on the nature of the overpopulation problem, which I perceive is the root cause of most of our problems in the world today.

Overpopulation arises because we human beings have been reproducing beyond what our planet can support.  I pinpoint overpopulation because the other causes all arise from this basic cause.  Human reproduction is due to desire, subsistence, and a will to survive and exist.

These lead to individual, group and racial interactions, which are classified as competition, cooperation, and trade exchanges.  These activities lead to languages, organisations and beliefs, which build trust between individuals.  All these can be considered human developments and creations enabled by more control over our future, which is progress as human beings evolve for the better.

The dark side of all these is that this amount of work can tire us, leading to laziness, greed and a will for power, which if not properly harnessed, can lead to conflicts.

What do all these mean for me as a disabled Christian and responsible Democrat in my country Singapore, ASEAN and the world?  As a disabled Christian, I focus on working and living within the boundaries of my religious and philosophical beliefs, biblical interpretations, disabilities due to my medical conditions, and medication constraints.  I had to reinterpret God as data and information to reduce conflicts with my work doing AI.

Being a responsible Democrat is more difficult given the problems of reproduction, because democracy is about rule by majority consensus, so the more people you have, whether through reproduction or influence, the greater the chances of power, which may pave the way for a more predictable future.  Given the problems of climate change and the divide between developed and developing countries, responsible Democrats will have to limit their use of energy and spend more on technologies that may reduce the problems of climate change.  We will also have to constrain our reproductive impulses, and continue to educate people from the developing world that having more children does not lead to a better life even if there are realistic economic factors at work, such as in family run agriculture businesses, because all the labour can be undertaken by non-family members hired for the job.
